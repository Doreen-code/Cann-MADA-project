# results

This folder and subfolders contain results produced by the code, such as figures and tables, and other files.

The 'tables-and-figures.qmd' file contains the code to produce the correctly formatted tables and figures for the manuscript. I wanted each of the tables and figures in the manuscript to follow the same color scheme and set-up, so I fixed their formatting in this .qmd to make it easier on myself.
